# Liri Node App

Liri is a command line node.js application that, similar to Apple's Siri, will process a handful of commands and return information for you.

Using the Twitter, request, and Spotify npm packages, you can run a small assortment of commands.

1. command-list: This command will print and display the list of command options to the user.

2. my-tweets: This command will print the last 20 tweets of the authenticated user along with the tweet date and time.

3. spotify-this-song: Using this command followed by a song title will return Spotify information for that track.

4. movie-this: This command followed by the title of a movie will return OMDB information on the searched movie.

5. do-what-it-says: Using this command will pull whatever command and search term is in the random.txt file and run that command.
